# Numpy-Based Neural Network


This is a feed-forward neural network written with Python and NumPy. The goal of this project was to learn the theory behind neural networks and to build a network from scratch using only basic modules.

Features:
- Trains the network on a given dataset and runs validation, plotting error over epochs.
- Automatically breaks as over-training is detected.
- Allows for the use of 1 to 5 hidden layers. 
- Includes options to test hyper-parameters, running up to 5 variations of a particular hyper-parameter and displaying the final error of each in a histogram.
